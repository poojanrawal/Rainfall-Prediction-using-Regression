# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Regression

The Project deals with current supervised learning models which are based on machine learning algorithm for Rainfall prediction. We have applied different machine learning algorithms such as CatBoost, Random Forest, XGBoost and Decison Tree on Rainfall Data and compared them on RMSE and R2 values. Our motive is to get optimized results that provides a comparison of various evaluation metrics ofÂ machine learning techniques and their reliability to predict amount of rainfall by analyzing the weather data.

# Problem-Statement

Build an efficient Regression Model that should predict the the amount of Rainfall.

# Dataset

We have used the Datset from Kaggle, Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package

# Preprocessing and Model Building

The File for Preprocessing and model building named "Rainfall Prediction Using Regression.ipynb" is uploaded here.
